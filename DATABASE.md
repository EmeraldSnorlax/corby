### SQLite Workbench:

If you do not have a version, then you can download an editor for this database. I recommend using [db browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/). Go [here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) and download the required version of the program for your OS.

Now you have to create a db by clicking on the button `New Database.`

![dbguide6](https://i.imgur.com/fNruCDl.png)

Enter a name for the database `corby.db` and save it along the path `corby/src/main/resources/corby.db`. In the window that opens after creating, click `Cancel`.

![dbguide7](https://i.imgur.com/wcYR7Kz.png)

Go to the created database, click on the tab `Execute SQL` and click on the button `Open SQL file` and select the file that is located along the path `corby/scripts/setupdb.sql`. Click on the button `Execute all SQL`, and then press `Write Changes` or `Ctrl + S`.
